  <h1 class="mainheads">Introduction</h1>
  <p class="mainps">
    I'm currently a CPA working for a small public accounting firm where I preparing tax returns and providing bookkeeping services to a variety of clientele.
    From CPA to web development/comp sci seems like a huge swinging of the pendulum.... 
    
    Although, I’m desperate to make a career change, what is most important to me is striving to make The Lord God Jesus Christ preeminent in my life.  All the pertinent things in my life will be sustained and come to pass as long I make Him my daily bread.

  <h1 class="mainheads">Where I’m from</h1>
  <p class="mainps">
  I was born in Kington, Jamaica, but I’m from the Inland Empire (or the I.E.).  The I.E.  consist of two counties east of Los Angeles the take up a lot of real estate in Southern California.  I spent essentially ALL of my life in Riverside County.  I spent the years of my youth in the city of Riverside and my teen years in Riverside’s brother city, Corona.
  I received my degree for the University of La Verne- a B.S. in accounting.  In the near future I plan on attending Cal Poly Pomona to get my masters in computer science.

  <h1 class="tidbitshead">Some other tid-bits</h1>

  <h3>Hobbies..?</h3>
  <p>
  Hobbies have been scarce in my life over the past few years.  BUT…
  When I do have time for them again…
  <ul> 
  <li>I like to study theology & the bible</li>
  <li>I like to be active—from road biking to camping- gotta stay moving and active.</li>
  <li>I like to do a bit of gaming- game of choice, rather the only game I really play is Street fighter.  Street Fighter V is the latest rendition and it drops early next year.</li>
  <li>Lastly I like to listen to music and play the guitar, watch anime and just hang-out!</li>
   </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Dream job..?</h3>
  <p>
  My dream job is to not have a job.  Well a job in the conventional sense.  I want to create passive income streams via investments in real estate and other ventures.
  However, the job I desire at the moment and would like to do regardless if I have passive income streams is web and software development/engineering.  The companies I’d like to work for and which are no surprise: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Dropbox, SAVEFORCE, Yelp, Palantir Technologies, Twitter, box, The Climate Corporation, LYTRO ILLUM, NVIDIA, twitch and Thumbtack.
  I really enjoy this stuff and plan to do it in some form for a long time.
  </p>
  <h3>Music of late…?</h3>
  <p>
  Lately I’ve been taking a steady dose of progressive dance music, 80s hits (name Tears for Fears), iHeart radio station Cold Play and ALT 98.7 w/ Kade.
